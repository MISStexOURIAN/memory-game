# Memory-Game
This is an app written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to mimic the classic memory card game in which players attempt to find matching cards in as few moves as possible.

## Instructions 
This game is designed for two players, so first the users must assign Player 1 and Player 2.  The underlined player name indicates whose turn it is.  The active player clicks or taps two cards to turn them over.  If they match, they remain turned over and no further action is needed.  If they don't match, the cards automatically turn over.  In either case, the game automatically switches turns to the other player (as indicated by the underline), and the other player repeats these steps.  Continue playing until all matches are found.

## Features
- The Start Over button may be clicked at any time during the game to restart the game.  Note that all data will be reset, and the cards will reshuffle.
- The timer tracks how long it takes to complete the game.
- The stars indicate how efficiently the players are finding matches.  3 stars = maximum efficiency, 2 stars = average, 1 star = poor
- The guesses feature counts how many total pairs are turned over.
- Under each player's name is the number of matched pairs found by that player.
- When the game is completed, a modal will pop up indicating the winner, the star rating, and the total time.
